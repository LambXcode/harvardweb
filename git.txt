Merge Conflicts - trying to make changes when others are also, we have to figure out how to handle them.

Style:
<<<<

===
My changes 
>> pull >>> 2918731984719847198 -- hash of commit 

Resolution:

remove metadata from file, remote version or combine changes...

git logs:
-commit logs

git reset: 
-git reset --hard <commit>
-git reset --hard origin/master

Branching:

gits way of working on the repository at the same time. Eliminates linear flows. 

master should contain stable and up to date versions of the code. 

newer aditional features should have an additional "feature" branch

we switch where our head points to for traversal purposes. 

when we happy we can merge the branches onto the master branch. 

git branch:

tells us what branch we are on. 

git checkout -b "style"

git merge -b "style"
